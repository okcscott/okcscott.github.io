Raisemore is a *white label* mobile solution for fundraising. It leverages social media and crowdfunding to allow attenders to recruit and fundraise right insdie of the app.

> RAISEMORE IS MORE THAN YOUR MOBILE APP. WE HELP YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR USERS TO DRIVE ENGAGEMENT AND INCREASE DONATIONS. IT'S MOBILE FUNDRAISING MADE SIMPLE.

### Ionic

I worked on Raisemore's mobile team. We used ionic to allow us to build a modular application that could be deployed to multiple app stores, from a single code base.

### Modules

One of the big selling points of Ionic is that the customer can turn on and off the different features they want for their event. Things like **Leaderboards**, **Galleries**, and **Teams** could be selected and customized for their event and brand.
