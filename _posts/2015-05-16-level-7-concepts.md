Level 7 is a custom identification product company, specializing in corporate name badges. They've been doing direct mail campaigns for almost 16 years, and were ready to add an online presence. They wanted a very customized e-commerce solution. On the website, customers can easily build custom products from a slew of options, and customize them with text for their employees. Returning customers can quickly re-order & customize their favorite products. And the Level 7 team can manage all of it from a friendly admin section.
