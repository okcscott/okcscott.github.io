Armada Tracking is a GPS fleet tracking SaaS application. You get access to a realtime map that shows exactly where your fleet is at the moment. You can also view any vehicle's recent trips, and review their driving behaviors. 

I worked on a reporting dashboard that allowed an admin to view the driving behaviors of their users. They could sort by the amount of time they spent speeding, number of hard stops, and other metrics. I also worked on colorizing the trips based on speed (you can see that in the screenshot above). The style was inspired by Nike+ Run Club app.
