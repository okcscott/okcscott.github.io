Lab 21 is a custom badge maker for corporate name badges. They've been doing direct mail campaigns for almost 16 years, and were ready to add an online presence. They wanted a simple e-commerce solution, with lots of bells-n-whistles. On the website, customers can easily build custom badges from a slew of options, and customize them with text for their employees. Returning customers can quickly re-order & customize their favorite products. And the Lab 21 team can manage all of it from a friendly admin section.
