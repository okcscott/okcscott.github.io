Strayhouse is a small coffee shop & bakery located in Clinton, OK.

### Mobile Truck

Strayhouse started as a mobile coffee truck, but quickly grew out of that. It was important to capture the spirit of how they started, but also highlight their new brick-and-mortar location.

### Menu & Storenvy

The long-term plan for the site was to be able to shop for their locally sourced coffee as well as to be able to order online. I chose Storenvy because it's free and familiar. The menu itself is controlled in the admin of the shop, so they can update prices, and add items, without ever needing to work with a developer.
